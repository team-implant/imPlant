# üåøGreenhouse Plant Monitoring System

This project is an IoT-based system that monitors plant health, controls watering, and provides both real-time and historical data through a modern web interface. It brings together hardware, backend services, and a responsive frontend.

---

## üì¶ Overview

The system is divided into **three main parts**:

### üîå IoT Layer
- Runs on an **ATMega2560 microcontroller** (programmed in C)
- Sends **sensor data over TCP**
- A **C# server** translates TCP messages and exposes a **gRPC interface**

### üñ•Ô∏è Backend Layer
- Built using **C# and .NET**
- Connects to a database via **Entity Framework Core**
- Uses **gRPC** to communicate with the IoT server
- Includes a **Python microservice** (using Flask) for machine learning, which exposes a **REST API**

### üñºÔ∏è Frontend Layer
- Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**
- Uses **Axios** and **React Query** to fetch and display data
- Includes features such as **JWT authentication**, **dashboards**, and **ML insights**
